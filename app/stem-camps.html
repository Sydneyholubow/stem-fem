        is a rigorous four-week summer academic experience to introduce high school students 
        to engineering through hands-on classes, labs, and team-based projects in the summer 
        after 11th grade. Designed for students who are excited about learning, have 
        demonstrated their ability to excel at math and science in their high school classes, 
        and who have no prior background (or very little) in engineering or computer science, 
        with few opportunities to explore these fields.
