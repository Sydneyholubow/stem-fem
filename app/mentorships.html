        <a href="">Girls Code the World Aspire Program</a>
is a mentorship program for women and girls of all ages. Mentees 
        are eligible for this program when they reach the sixth grade and 
        can remain a mentee for as long as they choose, with graduate school 
        being the oldest level supported. Every mentee is paired with a role 
        model that is just one “step” further along than them (mentors in high 
        school are paired with middle school students, mentors in college are 
        paired with high schoolers, etc.) and will participate in a variety of 
        activities through the organization. These activities vary based on the 
        mentor’s age category.

        >
        was created in response to the lack of women in STEM with the hope of increasing STEM interest and career awareness. They compiled a database full of women from all around the world and different parts of the field who are interested in serving as role models for young women interested in STEM. Young women are able to access this directory and pick their own mentor based on their field of work and type of mentorship they are offering.
