        is a 24-hour female-empowerment hackathon with a specific mission to encourage all individuals to learn about and become change agents for the gender gap in technology by innovating and inspiring with code. They believe in the value of hosting events that bring together people of all genders under a common goal: to make tech an inclusive space that celebrates women (trans and cis) and other minorities.
